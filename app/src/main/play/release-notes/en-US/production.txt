Improved handling of large datasets and autofill, plus better design-system consistency. Added standalone notes, zero-knowledge user state, local database pagination, and faster search. Added autofill create&fill flow. Data refresh works in the background, the accessibility dialog has a larger tap target, and multiple UI issues are fixed. Home list and filters are now on MVI.
