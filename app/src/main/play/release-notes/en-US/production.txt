This release focuses on adding additional features for resource metadata - support for editing and creating resources with multiple URIs, as well as full support for resource icons. It also brings log improvements by obfuscating the passbolt backend base URL, which the users often want hidden. Additionally, the application architecture has started to be migrated to MVI/Compose.
