This release contains improvements for handling large datasets and autofill, and makes the app more consistent with the design system. It adds standalone note support, zero-knowledge user state, full pagination for large resource lists, faster local search using the database engine, and instant autofill for items created during the autofill flow. Background refresh now continues even when the app is backgrounded, the autofill accessibility dialog has a larger tap target, and several UI issues (text overflow, color tinting, button styling, and multiline placeholders) have been fixed. The home list and filters are now migrated to MVI, providing a more maintainable foundation.
